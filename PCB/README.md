# Printed circuit board design files

The PCB is redesigned to accept:
- AD8361 TruPWR detector chips (instead of diode rectifiers)
- PIC16F18877 chip in either the UQFN-40 or the TQFP-44 packages
- PIC16F1454 chip in either the UQFN-16 or the TSSOP-14 packages
- the BNC connectors are relocated onto the rear panel PCB

The SprintLayout folder contains the source files (*.LAY6) editable/viewable with the SprintLayout6 software.
The GERBER folder contains the files necessary for PCB production (I sent them to JLCPCB, the PCBs passed all their checks and were produced successfuly).
