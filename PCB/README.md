# Printed circuit board design files

The SprintLayout folder contains the source files (*.LAY6) editable/viewable with the SprintLayout6 software.
The GERBER folder contains the files necessary for PCB production (I sent them to JLCPCB, the PCBs passed all their checks and were produced successfuly).
